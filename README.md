5. We can Install Custom firmware now

### Why install Custom firmware?

Custom firmwares are best because you don't have to install apps by yourself

We will be installing Custom firmware called [Xtreme Firmware](https://flipper-xtre.me/)

If you're going to install apps, you will need to know that you're running Xtreme Developer version
